## Multimaterial Printing

When working with a machine that has more than one Z-Axis, it is
useful to use the [`rename_axis()`](/mecode/api-reference/mecode/#mecode.main.G.rename_axis) function. Using this function your
code can always refer to the vertical axis as 'Z', but you can dynamically
rename it.
